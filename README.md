## Overview
### Description
There will be 1000 with three different rarities, 600 rare, 300 epic, and 100 legendary. Each NFT rewards their holder with a portion of the profited "house money," and each tier will have a higher percent than the last. Additionally, the holders who wish to gamble can connect their NFT to the website and get the increased percentage of winning that's attached with their rarity. The plan is to do the mint (mint price undecided rn) like a day or even a couple hours before we launch the gambling slot machine website and then whoever minted one could connect their nft to the website to then get the improved odds, otherwise people who donâ€™t have an nft can still play but will get the base odds. We would connect the app to users NFT wallet and give them the ability to gamble their NFT's or house money. The interface would be sleek, simple, and easy to use.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:**
 Casino Games: Gambling and web 3
 
- **Mobile:**
 This app will also be available as a website and the available features will be the same.  
 
- **Story:**
 Allows user to spin slot machine, if they get certain patterns of images they win a percentage
 of the pot based on what images matched together and how many. The app will then give the user what 
 they earned or take out what the lost from their wallet. The app will force the user to approve removing 
 money from their account before the spin, if they win it is returned to them with what they won, but if 
 they lose the money will go to the house wallet. 
 
- **Market:**
 Any person can use this app, but they have to be of age to have NFT wallet or cypto wallet (18+)
 young people who are into web 3. 
 
- **Habit:**
 How often the app will be used, can be used as often/ unoften as a user wants, 
 you can use the app whenever you feel like it, no notifications will be coming from 
 the app unless we update their wallet with their winnings/ NFT shareholders profits. 
 
- **Scope:**
 Anybody can use it in the beginning, and we could expand with the release of each NFT, 
 eventually be able to put your own NFT in the app and use the slot machine with your NFT's. 
 Users can buy a NFT collection from us (4- pack of NFTs) to use in the slot machine.
